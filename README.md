# Isabelle Hypermaps
This project is a formalisation of hypermaps, following the foundations developed for the Coq proof of the four colour theorem, available [here](https://github.com/math-comp/fourcolor).

This library was developed using Isabelle 2021, and depends on the List-Index and Graph_Theory afp entries. They can be downloaded from isa-afp.org. 

The ROOTS file assumes that the afp theories can be found under ~/Documents/afp/thys/ - this can be easily changed by editing the ROOTS file.

The Perm theory was developed by Florian Haftmann and Manuel Eberl, and is only provided here because it has not been officially released.
