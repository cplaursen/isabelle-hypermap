# Formalization of planar hypermaps in Isabelle/HOL

Hypermaps are the data structure used to represent planar maps for the Coq proof of the four color theorem, available [here](https://github.com/math-comp/fourcolor).

This development aims to implement hypermaps in Isabelle/HOL, with the aim of eventually producing a full proof of the four color theorem.
To this end, the repository mirrors the file structure and operations used in the Coq proof.
